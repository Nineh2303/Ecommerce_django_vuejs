This is the first demo project built by me ^^ (and the tutor on youtube)
The web application was base on python-django back-end server and Vuejs front-end framework 

How to try it: 
make sure that you installed python and nodejs evironment
Clone this project to your computer 
-- Setting up your python virtual environment inside the project : 
  $py -m venv venv 
-- Activate your environment 
  $ ./venv/Scripts/activate 
--install all neccesary module for project , it was note in file requirement.txt 
$ pip install -r requirement.txt 
--run server 
% py ./manage.py runserver
it's done for django 
With vuejs 
Goto inside vue folder and install all packet : 
$ npm install 
run server : 
$ npm run serve 
Wait a few minute and the browse the Vue serve 

Have a great experience :((( . 
Thank all ! <3
